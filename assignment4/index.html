        <h1>A Simple Blog</h1>
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey, everyone. I am Mehang Rai. I am from Nepal, a country situation among Himalayas in South East Asia.
            As of now, I am a graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Baylor University, Waco,
            Texas.
            Looking from my major, you can tell that I love coding and have been doing so for the last 8 years.
            I did my undergrad at Pulchowk Campus, Lalipur, Nepal and my experience was really good over there. After
            my undergrad, I went for industrial experience to enhance my coding skill. But after 2 and half years,
            I wanted to more academic experience. So, here I am.
        </p>
        <h2>Programming/Coding</h2>
        <h3>What I think about coding?</h3>
        <p>
            With the tremendous development in technology, I think it's a must to have some degree of programming
            knowledge. And it is not that hard to learn. Although the presence of large number of programming
            languages and frameworks could overwhelm a beginner, the interested person will only need to look at few of
            those programming languages and frameworks that interests them.
        </p>
        <h3>My Favorite Programming Languages/Libraries</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>React JS</li>
            <li>VB .Net</li>
            <li>Django Framework</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Some traits of those programming languages/libraries</h3>
        <h4>Python</h4>
        <div class="language_details">
            <img src="Python.png" alt="A snippet of code written in python." id="python_img"/>
            <p>
                Python is one of the most popular programming language in the world. There are a lot of python users out
                there. A lot of people like it because it resembles pseudocode, which makes it easier to learn and
                follow through. But being a dynamic language, it can cause problem for some developers to find the bug.
                However there exist different IDE's like PyCharm which helps to identify and locate the bug easily.
                Also, the vast amount of open source libraries present on the internet makes our task really easy.\
            </p>

        <h4>Java</h4>
        <div class="language_details">
            <img src="Java.png" alt="A snippet of code written in java." id="java_img"/>
            <p>
                Java is the epitome of object oriented programming. If you want to program in object oriented, you
                cannot ask for more. Because of its pure object oriented nature, you can implement different design
                patterns that will make the code much more concise and elegant. It is one of the most popular language
                in the industry and lot of programmers prefer it. It can also be used in the communication and
                cybersecurity because it has lot of advance stuff present around.
            </p>

        <h4>React JS</h4>
        <div class="language_details">
            <img src="ReactJS.png" alt="A snippet of code written in React JS." id="reactjs_img"/>
            <p>
                React JS was developed by facebook. It is JavaScript library designed to create becautiful frontends.
                React JS has been popular nowadays because it is easy to learn. You just need to learn its basic
                principle, and you can program straightaway with only slight knowledge of JavaScript. Its syntax
                resembles the HTML syntax so it is quite easy to follow through. It flows the data from parent component
