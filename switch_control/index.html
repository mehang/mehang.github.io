    <h2>About this app</h2>
    <p>
        I have created a single switch interface for the calculator application. The design has been done in such
        a way to mimic a single switch interface which can be used by people with disabilities to communicate with
        the computing device. Since there is only one switch to control the calculator application interface, moving
        window approach was used, which moves continuous using timers along the row or different buttons. This enables
        the user to navigate to any desired buttons and input the desired equation. For the purpose of simulating real
        scenario, the "Enter" key was used as the single switch for interaction.
    </p>
    <h3>Instructions for using the app</h3>
    <p>
        In this app, interaction can be done using the select button or the "Enter" key in the keyboard. Since in a real
        life scenario, a physical switch will be used for the interaction, so the use of "Enter" key will be a much more
        accurate simulation. In the app, there is a moving window which moves constantly across rows and different
        elements.
        Initially the window moves in between rows i.e. from one row to another. When the switch is pressed on a desired
        focused row highlighted by orange color, the focus will now be shifted within the row and a green focus will
        continue
        to move among the different buttons of the row continuously. When the switch is clicked again, either the
        calculator
        button is clicked and input is being made or if the focus is on the row itself then the navigation will continue
        over rows i.e. to next row in a cycle. This latter option was added to allow users to correct the action of
        mistakenly selecting
        an incorrect row.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to this single switch interface, a 2 switch interface was also designed to compare the performance
        of the
        two. The 2 switch interface contains of two buttton: Next and Select. For the sake of replicating simulation,
        "Spacebar" key and "Enter" key of keyboard could be also used in place of Next and Select button respectively.
        The Next button is pressed when you want to navigate among different rows or different element i.e. buttons, and
        the
        Select button is pressed in order to enter the focus within a row or click a selected button. Similar to
        previous
        design, when a green focus is within a row, this escape the button selection mode and we can continue to
        navigate
        between different rows.
    </p>
    <h3>Test details</h3>
    <p>
        Two different kinds of test were performed. Firstly the speed of the moving window was varied by changing the
        interval
        value in the timer. Different values of timer were used in this test: 500ms, 1000ms and 1500ms. In the second
        test,
        the single switch interface was compared with the similar window based interface with two keys: Select and Next.
        Comparisons were made based on the number of errors made and speed of the experiment. Altogether 6 different
        expressions
        were used for testing. The calculator interface doesn't have an undo button so, whenever a mistake is made then,
        the user has to navigate to the Clear button indicate by "C" to clear everything and start all over again. This
        whole correction time was also added to the total time taken to calculate that expression.
    </p>
    <h3>Result</h3>
    <div>
        The result for different expressions were calculated on different window interval speed:
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Expression</th>
                <th> Time taken (Window speed=500 ms)</th>
                <th>Time taken (Window speed=1000 ms)</th>
                <th>Time taken (Window speed=1500 ms)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>98*10-2=</td>
                <td>40 seconds, 2 errors</td>

            </tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>1 minute 5 seconds, 3 errors</td>
                <td>1 minute 14 seconds, 0 errors</td>
                <td>1 minute 25 seconds, 1 error</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4400/11-5*20+96=</td>
                <td>53 seconds, 0 errors</td>
                <td>1 minute 52 seconds, 2 errors</td>
                <td>4 minute 3 seconds, 3 errors</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>12*33*44/2/2=</td>
                <td>1 minute 8 seconds, 1 error</td>
                <td>1 minute 10 seconds 0 errors</td>
                <td>1 minute 20 seconds 0 errors</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>67890-54321*4/2=</td>
                <td>3 minutes 9 seconds 4 errors</td>
                <td>1 minute 32 seconds 0 error</td>
                <td>3 minutes 40 seconds 1 error</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            Looking at the results, it can be seen that with window interval of 500 ms faster speed can be obtained,
            but at the same time there is more chance of making errors. Since the transition of focus is fast, there is
            high chance that a wrong button or row will be triggered. The correction of this action adds an extra amount
            of time because the process might have to be repeated. Similarly, for interval of 1500 ms, few number of
            errors were made, but the overall speed was slow because the transition of focus is triple the times at
            500 ms. In most of the case, this came out to be the slowest among the three options. There is a low chance
            of making an error, but provided there is an error then due to the process for correction, the total time
            increases by a significant amount. The interval of 1000 ms seems to balance the trade-off between speed and
            accuracy. It is faster than 1500 ms while maintaining the number of errors to a low number. Also whenever
            there was error, the amount of time taken for correction was relatively low because of its relatively faster
            transition. This shows that the window interval needs to be defined according to user capability.
        </p>
    </div>

        Since the window interval of 1000 ms was found out to be efficient, for the next experiment the single switch
        interface was compared against the two-switch interface.
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Expression</th>
                <th> Time taken (Single switch interface)</th>
                <th>Time taken (Two switch interface)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>98*10-2=</td>
                <td>57 seconds, 0 errors</td>
                <td>40 seconds, 0 errors</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>7*4+36/2=</td>
                <td>1 minute 1 seconds, 0 errors</td>
                <td>39 second, 0 errors</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>19+52-3+1-4=</td>
                <td>1 minute 11 seconds, 0 errors</td>
                <td>40 seconds, 0 errors</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4400/11-5*20+96=</td>
                <td>1 minute 50 seconds, 2 errors</td>
                <td>1 minute 11 seconds, 1 error</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>12*33*44/2/2=</td>
                <td>1 minute 10 seconds 0 errors</td>
                <td>49 seconds 0 errors</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>67890-54321*4/2=</td>
                <td>1 minute 34 seconds 0 errors</td>
                <td>1 minutes 5 seconds 0 errors</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            From the result above it can be seen that the two switch interface was comparatively faster than the
            single switch interface. Navigation was comparatively quicker, the purpose of navigation and selection was
            segregated among the two different switches. The navigation in single switch was automated by the transition
            interval due to which the transition of focus was entirely dependent on the system, thus resulting in slow
            action unlike the two switch interface where user had the freedom on the speed of navigation. However the
            single switch interface provided a simple interface. Use of only a single button could be helpful for the
            people who have difficulty in using two switches. In terms of number of errors the two switch interface was
            better, because of the same reason that it gives more freedom to user. But, the number of errors was quite
            low for the single switch as well and that is due to the favorable window speed for the user.
