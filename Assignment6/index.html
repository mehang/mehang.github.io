        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <h2>Testing of the magnifier</h2>
        Since the video recording did not capture the magnified view, I had to write down my experience.
        A magnifying tool is just a simple software that increase the size of the content, similar to magnifying glass.
        Windows Operating System provides a very good magnifier tool. It comes pre-installed within the operating
        system.
        It was interesting that along with different scale of magnifying it gave different mode of magnification:
        <ul>
            <li>Full screen - Magnifies the content and displays it on the whole screen</li>
            <li>Lens - Magnifies the content surrounding the cursor and displays only on the rectangular display that
                follows
                the cursor
            </li>
            <li>Docked - Magnifies the portion surrounding the cursor and display on a separate display docked at the
                top of
                the screen
            </li>
        </ul>
        I used different magnification scale and its mode for reading a blog of soccer news on <a
            href="https://goal.com">https://goal.com</a>.
        I used it for quite sometime, and since I am used to looking at normal mode i.e. 100%, my eye was strained
        at higher zoom level because of the magnified texts and icons. I also had to move around the cursor a lot because only a small portion
        of content could be contained in the magnified view. Also, since I didn't have a mouse I also used to
        continuously press the arrow keys to navigate webpage sometimes, as the touchpad did not allowed to do so.
        A 300% zoom was too much for me as I did not get enough context in that view, but I would say for low vision
        people it might be useful although a bit time consuming. The higher the zoom level, the more scrolling there is.
        Out of the three modes, I liked the docked mode because it gives the user a point of reference in regular webpage
        through cursor and separates the zoomed view on the top dock of the screen, which is wider than the lens mode.
        The lens mode is good but I lost track of content when switching in between lines as the magnified view is
        overlayed
        on top of the cursor. In full screen mode, I did not seem to have a point of reference as a whole and many
        things at higher zoom level were
        clipped away unlike in other two mode where the non-magnified section are still visible. But at the end, I would like to
        say that this magnifying tool is
        really good and I think it will definitely help low vision people, but I have concern regarding how it will be helpful in viewing video will be
        helpful because a lot of content will either be non-magnified or clipped out. I hope that will be addressed in
        the
        future. The picture from my testing are present over here. <a
            href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13BbIE4bGKzgbdIP33KwVeKT5DPi_bSh0?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13BbIE4bGKzgbdIP33KwVeKT5DPi_bSh0?usp=sharing</a>.
        <h2>Testing of the high-contrast</h2>
        Microsoft windows also provides toggling of high contrast. I test it for reading the blog and I really liked
        it.
        All the white colors were inverted to black, so it really relaxed my eyes and also all the contents were quite
        distinguishable. For someone with color blindness or low vision, this could be really helpful. The contrasting color
        could save time in finding the content or web element. The picture from my testing are present over here.<a
            href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13BbIE4bGKzgbdIP33KwVeKT5DPi_bSh0?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13BbIE4bGKzgbdIP33KwVeKT5DPi_bSh0?usp=sharing</a>.
        <h2>Features added to this site for low vision users</h2>
        To assist the users with low vision, zooming features was added to the application. There are two buttons
        at the top of the website for increasing and decreasing the font size. The magnification is not limited to
        certain
        choice. As long as the button is clicked the content will keep growing or shrinking in size. Right now, limit
        has
        not been set as it is difficult to assume what is the right limit for low vision users because they can have
        varying
        degree of visions.

        Along with zooming feature, high-contrast feature was added too. It helps to easily distinguish/differentiate
        the
        background
        color with the color of contents in the front. So, any item or content can be pointed to immediately. A
        high-contrast
        can also aid some of the color blind people because high-contrast mode could turn into something more
        perceivable
        not
        only for
        the low vision users but for the color blind people as well.
        Since these two functions could be combined, users could combine and use them according to their preference.
